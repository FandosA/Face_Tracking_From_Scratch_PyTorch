# Face Tracking In Real Time
Implementation of a deep learning model based on the VGG16 neural network to track faces on video or with a camera in real time. This proyect has been done following [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_W4EYtsa10&t=6473s) tutorial, in which [Nicholas Renotte](https://www.youtube.com/@NicholasRenotte) implemented a model using the Tensorflow framework, and I took it to deploy and port it to PyTorch. To run the implementation, download this repository and run the ```setup.py``` script. It will create the necessary folders to prepare the dataset.

## Dataset preparation
To run the implementation it is necessary to prepare the dataset, and before that,
