# Face Tracking In Real Time
Implementation of a deep learning model based on the VGG16 neural network to track faces on video or with a camera in real time. This proyect has been done following [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_W4EYtsa10&t=6473s) tutorial, in which [Nicholas Renotte](https://www.youtube.com/@NicholasRenotte) implemented a model using the Tensorflow framework, and I took it to deploy and port it to PyTorch. The steps to follow to run the implementation are described below.
